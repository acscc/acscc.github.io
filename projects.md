Projects included mapping the pillars of support for the fossil fuel industry in order to develop effective ways to 'defeat the fossil Goliath', analyzing what the media emphasizes (e.g. technological solutions or climate justice) when reporting on the IPCC reports, trying to better understand the impact of celebrities such as Taylor Swift taking climate action, 'hacking' the food system to become more sustainable, building a web app that allows citizens to understand the carbon footprint of various activities in the city they live in, and conceptualizing the good life and how to achieve it.
