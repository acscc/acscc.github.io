title: Amsterdam Complexity School on Climate Change
---

The **Amsterdam Complexity School on Climate Change** is a one-week workshop where early-career researchers and other stakeholders working on climate change such as individuals in policy-making and non-governmental organizations come together to work together on interdisciplinary projects around climate change using complexity research as the backbone.

The complexity school will feature lectures, tutorials, and panel discussions by researchers, politicians, and other climate change stakeholders. **The primary focus of the workshop is for participants to engage in novel research projects.** These can span the entire range from highly abstract arguments and modeling to solving a concrete problem such as designing a specific intervention or campaign. Project ideas are proposed on the first day by both researchers and non-academic stakeholders. The participants will work collaboratively on these projects throughout the week and present their findings on Friday. While the most typical output of these projects will be research papers, we also encourage other forms of output, such as strategy papers, campaigns, or communication tools.
