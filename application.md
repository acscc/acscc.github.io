## Accommodation

We will provide you with shared rooms of 4-people at [Generator Hostel](https://staygenerator.com/hostels/amsterdam) in Oosterpark. We will split the rooms based on sex. If you prefer a different arrangement, please send us an email to [acscc@protonmail.com](mailto:acscc@protonmail.com). In case you prefer to have a single room, we ask you to arrange it yourself at [Generator Hostel](https://staygenerator.com/hostels/amsterdam).

## Travel Grant

We hope to enable all students independent of financial means to attend the winter school. Therefore, we have reserved a limited budget for travel grants. Please send us an email with a motivation (200 words) and a list of needed funds to our email address [acscc@protonmail.com](mailto:acscc@protonmail.com). With the acceptance letter, we will notify you with how much money we can support you. In case the required budget exceeds the available funds, we might not be able to cover all your needed costs.
