The Winter Workshop on Complex Systems originates from the initiative of a few individuals attending the Santa Fe Institute Summer School on Complex Systems 2014. The group sequentially became part of the current WWCS Steering Committee. Over the years, the workshop has grown into a larger community attracting young researchers from all over the world.
The Winter Workshop on Complex Systems is a one-week workshop where young researchers from all over the world gather together for discussing about complexity science. The primary focus of the workshop is for participants to engage into novel research projects.
During the workshop participants work on research projects whose preliminary results are presented at the end of the workshop. Participants are free to propose research projects and to discuss them until the beginning of the workshop on a dedicated web platform.
