The complexity school focuses on collaborative work among the participants, but also includes talks, a panel discussion, and tutorials which will be held by researchers, participants, and other climate change stakeholders.

A detailed program will be shared once the applications open on Nov 1st.

You can find the program of the previous ACSCC in [Past Editions](https://acscc.nl/past_editions/).
