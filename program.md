The complexity school will focus on collaborative work among the participants, but will also include presentations by world-renowned scientists, former members of parliament, corporate sustainability leaders, journalists, activists, and artists. There will also be a panel discussion.

We will announce the program for the 2026 edition in early September. For the programs of the 2024 and 2025 editions see [Past Editions](https://acscc.nl/past_editions/).
