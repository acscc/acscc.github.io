title:  Venue - Saline Royale

A UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1982, the Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans is the masterpiece of Claude Nicolas Ledoux (1736-1806), one of the Age of Enlightenment’s most visionary architects. The site is also a rare example of early industrial architecture based on a utopian plan. Originally designed for salt production, the Royal Saltworks was built by edict of Louis XV between 1775 and 1779, some 10 years before the French Revolution. Later abandoned and looted, then damaged by fire in 1918, the site was finally acquired by the department of Doubs in 1927 and was subsequently restored. A fascinating and unique monument, the Royal Saltworks is open to visitors all year round
