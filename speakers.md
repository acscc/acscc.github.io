<p>[Oscar Berglund](https://twitter.com/berglund_oscar) is a senior lecturer in international public and social policy at the University of Bristol. His research looks at political contestation of global processes like neoliberalisation, austerity and climate change. This includes both non-violent contestation by social movements and parliamentary forms of contestation. His research draws on a historical materialist theoretical framework with a focus on political agency and contestation. He is particularly interested in how social movements use civil disobedience to achieve their aims and how they justify their law-breaking.</p>
