  <p><a href='https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=DiCOJ64AAAAJ&hl=nl&oi=ao'>Tim Lenton</a> is Chair in Climate Change and Earth System Science at the University of Exeter. His reading of Jim Lovelockâ€™s books on Gaia, when he was an undergraduate, ignited his passion for studying the Earth as a whole system, forming the foundations of his research to date. Tim has made fundamental contributions to the study of climate tipping points and Earth system science more broadly, and his integrated view of our living planet is captured in his books <i>Revolutions That Made The Earth</i> and <i>Earth System Science: A Very Short Introduction</i>. In recent years, Tim has shifted his focus to identifying positive tipping points towards sustainability, and is currently on sabbatical to write a book on the subject. He is the lead author of the <a href='https://global-tipping-points.org/'>Global Tipping Points report</a>.

  <p><a href='https://twitter.com/IreMonasterolo'>Irene Monasterolo</a> is Professor of Climate Finance at the Utrecht University School of Economics, where she works on the role of finance in climate change mitigation and adaptation. Irene has developed methodological approaches to analyse the macro-financial criticality of climate risks and the role of green finance policies in the low-carbon transition. Her research on a climate stress tests and stock-flow consistent macro-economic models with heterogeneous, interacting agents has been published in journals such as <i>Science</i> and <i>Nature Climate Change</i> and applied by international financial institutions such as the World Bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the European Banking Authority, and national central banks. She is also an editor of the journal <i>Ecological Economics</i>.

  <p><a href='https://twitter.com/AartiGupta17'>Aarti Gupta</a> is an Professor of Global Environmental Governance at Wageningen University.
  She works on global environmental and climate governance, with a focus on transparency and accountability and the challenges of anticipatory governance of novel technologies (such as solar geo-engineering). She is a member of the Scientific Steering Committee of the Earth System Governance (ESG) research alliance and co-leads the international REIMAGINE consortium project on anticipatory climate governance in vulnerable regions of the global South. Aarti holds a PhD from Yale and has done postdoctoral research at Columbia and Harvard University in political science, international relations, and science and technology studies. She also worked outside of academia at the United Nations Development Programme in New York, Oxfam-Novib in the Hague, and Transparency International in Berlin.

  <img style="float: left; margin-right: 20px;" src="/assets/image23/speakers/oscar.jpg" width="25%"/>
  <p><a href='https://twitter.com/berglund_oscar'>Oscar Berglund</a> is a senior lecturer in international public and social policy at the University of Bristol. His research looks at political contestation of global processes like neoliberalisation, austerity and climate change. This includes both non-violent contestation by social movements and parliamentary forms of contestation. His research draws on a historical materialist theoretical framework with a focus on political agency and contestation. He is particularly interested in how social movements use civil disobedience to achieve their aims and how they justify their law-breaking.</p>

  <p><a href='https://twitter.com/MartheWens'>Marthe Wens</a> is an Assistant Professor at the Institute for Environmental Studies at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Her research concerns water security and societal impacts, with a specific focus on modelling the intertwined nature of drought risk and human adaptive behaviour. Marthe uses machine learning to create risk profiles to support disaster risk reduction efforts, and agent-based models to evaluate the feedbacks between drought events, food security, and adaptation. She is part of several United Nations programs and very active with Scientist Rebellion.</p>
