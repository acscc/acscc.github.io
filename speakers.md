  <p><a href='https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=DiCOJ64AAAAJ&hl=nl&oi=ao'>Tim Lenton</a> is Chair in Climate Change and Earth System Science at the University of Exeter. His reading of Jim Lovelock’s books on Gaia, when he was an undergraduate, ignited his passion for studying the Earth as a whole system, forming the foundations of his research to date. Tim has made fundamental contributions to the study of climate tipping points and Earth system science more broadly, and his integrated view of our living planet is captured in his books <i>Revolutions That Made The Earth</i> and <i>Earth System Science: A Very Short Introduction</i>. In recent years, Tim has shifted his focus to identifying positive tipping points towards sustainability, and is currently on sabbatical to write a book on the subject. He is the lead author of the <a href='https://global-tipping-points.org/'>Global Tipping Points report</a>.

  <p><a href='https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=LtjhLZAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao'>Joyeeta Gupta</a> is Professor of Environment and Development in the Global South at the University of Amsterdam and IHE Delft Institute for Water Education. Her work centers on climate justice, equity, and sustainable development, with a particular focus on the impacts of climate change on vulnerable populations and ecosystems. Joyeeta’s research is deeply influenced by her background in law and her commitment to addressing power imbalances in global environmental governance. She has written four books on climate change and global governance and was a lead author on the fourth IPCC report. Currently, she co-chairs the Earth Commission, a body that aims to define safe and just boundaries for a thriving planet. Joyeeta was a recipient of the "Dutch Nobel Prize" (the Spinoza Prize) in 2023.

  <p><a href='https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=Rk7g1U0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao'>Doyne Farmer</a> is Director of the Complexity Economics programme at the Institute for New Economic Thinking at Oxford University, External Professor at the Santa Fe Institute, and Chief Scientist at Macrocosm. He has made fundamental contributions to chaos theory and is renowned for his pioneering work in complexity economics, financial stability, and technological progress, especially as they relate to a low-carbon future. As a graduate student, he built the first wearable digital computer to successfully beat the game of roulette and later founded Prediction Company, one of the first quantitative automated trading firms. Doyne’s book, <i>Making Sense of Chaos: A Better Economics for a Better World</i>, published in 2024, synthesizes his journey from chaos theory to building innovative frameworks for a more resilient and equitable economy.
