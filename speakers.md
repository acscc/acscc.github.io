  <p><a href='https://twitter.com/berglund_oscar'>Oscar Berglund</a> is a senior lecturer in international public and social policy at the University of Bristol. His research looks at political contestation of global processes like neoliberalisation, austerity and climate change. This includes both non-violent contestation by social movements and parliamentary forms of contestation. His research draws on a historical materialist theoretical framework with a focus on political agency and contestation. He is particularly interested in how social movements use civil disobedience to achieve their aims and how they justify their law-breaking.</p>

  <p><a href='https://twitter.com/MartheWens'>Marthe Wens</a> is an Assistant Professor at the Institute for Environmental Studies at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Her research concerns water security and societal impacts, with a specific focus on modelling the intertwined nature of drought risk and human adaptive behaviour. Marthe uses machine learning to create risk profiles to support disaster risk reduction efforts, and agent-based models to evaluate the feedbacks between drought events, food security, and adaptation. She is part of several United Nations programs and very active with Scientist Rebellion.</p>
