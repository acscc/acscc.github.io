  <p><a href='https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=DiCOJ64AAAAJ&hl=nl&oi=ao'>Tim Lenton</a> is Chair in Climate Change and Earth System Science at the University of Exeter. His reading of Jim Lovelock’s books on Gaia, when he was an undergraduate, ignited his passion for studying the Earth as a whole system, forming the foundations of his research to date. Tim has made fundamental contributions to the study of climate tipping points and Earth system science more broadly, and his integrated view of our living planet is captured in his books <i>Revolutions That Made The Earth</i> and <i>Earth System Science: A Very Short Introduction</i>. In recent years, Tim has shifted his focus to identifying positive tipping points towards sustainability, and is currently on sabbatical to write a book on the subject. He is the lead author of the <a href='https://global-tipping-points.org/'>Global Tipping Points report</a>.
